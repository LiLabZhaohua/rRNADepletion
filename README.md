# rRNADepletion

This repository contains scripts used to generate probe sequences for rRNA depletion.

These scripts were used in our manuscript:

Gu, H., Sun, Y.H. and Li, X.Z., 2020. [Novel rRNA-depletion methods for total RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling developed for avian species](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.294595v1.abstract). bioRxiv.
